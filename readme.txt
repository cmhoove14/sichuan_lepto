exploratory_analysis.R

	exploratory analysis of database
	investigation of spatial and temporal dynamics
	univariate analysis (only lepto data)


exploratory_twnshp.R

	exploratory analysis of database and covariates at township level
	correlation plots with rainfall data

lepto_spatialYearly.R

	tentative to perform spatial modeling of lepto data on year-by-year data
	moved to modeling of region 1 only to avoid the problem of zero townships


lepto_spatialYearly_region1.R

	same as lepto_spatialYearly.R but focusing on a subregion (northern cluster)
	just fitted a Poisson model
	need to do some exploratory analysis of correlations to be able to go further

var_rainfall.R

	formatting of rainfall data
	extract rainfall features from raster to township level data
